# Statistical-Inference-Course-Project
Project from Statistical Inference course in the Data Science Specialisation

In part 1 of this project we are investigating the exponential distribution in R and comparing it with the Central Limit Theorem using a simulation exercise.

In part 2 of this this project we are performing basic inferential data analysis using the ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.
